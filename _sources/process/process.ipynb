    "4. Build solutions\n",

    "## Identify the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelling problems are often open-ended in the sense that there are many different solutions, different levels of complexity, different tools that can ne applied and it's up to us to decide how to proceed. It's a challenge even to know where to start! To be able to begin the modelling process, we need to refine the problem to be more specific. This often takes the form of a specific research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it is too broad to say \"We want to model a lithium ion battery\". It is not clear where to start or what the goal is. A more specific question we could model is: \"What is the optimal form of the relationship that describes electrode kinetics?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "And sometimes the question is also too broad: \"How does a sensor behave when it is placed in an electrolyte?\". Here, it is not clear exactly what we would be modelling or trying to taking into account.  A better problem statement is \"What are the effects on capacitance in a sensor if the dielectric constant of the adjacent electrolyte depends on the ion concentration?\"."

    "## Variables and Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world phenonema is very difficult to model because there are numerous variables and factors that are not controlled. We often cannot account for all of the components of the problem, and so we need to make choices about what is appropriate to include in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "For variables, these are often related to the problem statement.  In the case of the sensor described in 1, the variables are capacitance, voltage, (electric) potential, and time. (Here, there are a host of parameter values as well)."

    "\n",
    "For both examples in 1 above, one assumption that is made is that the materials used to construct the battery and the sensor are homogeneous.  This means that they have a uniform consistency with no defects.  In practice, this is certainly not true, as defects can easily make their way into the manufacturing process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One specific example: Sensors often contain an oxide layer (usually silicon dioxide, SiO$_2$, and more recently tantalum pentoxide, Ta$_2$O$_5$) to help regulate the current through the sensor.  Creating an oxide if a very poorly controlled process and it is very common to have other molecules in the oxide layer that are not e.g., silicon or oxygen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we also want to identify key relationships between variables.  These usually take the form of physical laws and/or governing equations\n",

    "        - Notice here the different areas we are pulling relationships from!\n",
    "\n",
