# Objects in Motion

## Big Ideas

* **Newton's second law of motion** gives rise to a system of differential equations which models an object in motion.
* **Constitutive laws** such as **Hooke's law** for springs and **Stokes' law** for drag are equations that describe individual components of a mathematical model. Constitutive laws are themselves mathematical models!
* Any model of a real-world phenomenon will involve many **parameters** and the **nondimensionalization** procedure simplifies the model and determines what role the system parameters play.
* Use **SciPy** to compute **numerical solutions** of differential equations. A computational approach to mathematical modelling allows us to easily simulate and visualize models.

## Learning Goals

* Apply physical laws to construct mathematical models of objects in motion
* Apply nondimensionalization process and interpret dimensionless parameters
* Compute numerical solutions of systems of differential equations
