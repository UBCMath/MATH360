## Learning Goals

* Identify mathematical problems where a deterministic model would be appropriate
* Apply conservation and constitutive laws to construct deterministic models
* Apply nondimensionalization to a differential equation and interpret dimensionless parameters
* Solve ordinary differential equations both analytically and numerically
