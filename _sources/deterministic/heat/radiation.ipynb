    "## Thermal Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thermal radiation** is heat emitted as electromagnetic waves. The heat that we feel from the Sun is thermal radiation and in fact all matter (with temperature greater than 0K) emits thermal radiation. Different kinds of matter emit thermal radiation at different frequencies (or wavelengths) and higher frequency (shorter wavelengths) corresponds to higher energy. Thermal radiation is visible when the radiation is emitted with wavelengths 380 to 750 nanometers (or frequencies 400 to 790 THz). [Thermal imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography) allows us to \"see\" heat emitted by all matter."
