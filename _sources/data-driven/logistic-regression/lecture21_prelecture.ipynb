    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Summarize properties of the logistic function and the weight and bias parameters\n",
    "* Compare and contrast cost functions for logistic regression models such as mean least squares and cross entropy\n",
    "* Implement regularization terms in cost functions and tune regularization parameters\n",
    "* Approximate optimal model parameters for logistic regression models using `sklearn`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prelecture Activities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Readings\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Wikipedia: Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)\n",
    "* [Scikit-learn: Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the logistic function? What do the weight $W$ and bias $b$ parameters represent?\n",
    "* What is logistic regression? How is it different/similar compared to linear regression?\n",
    "* What is mean least squares? What is cross-entropy? How are they different?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\sigma(x) = \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ be the logistic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine the values $\\sigma(0)$ and $\\sigma'(0)$.\n",
    "* Show that $\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))$.\n",
    "* Sketch the graph of the logistic function $\\sigma(x)$."
