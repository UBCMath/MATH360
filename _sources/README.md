# Introduction to Mathematical Modelling

## Learning Goals

* Classify and contrast different types of mathematical models
* Construct a mathematical model by applying the modelling process
* Simulate a mathematical model using mathematical software
* Evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of a mathematical model and its computed solution
* Describe quantitative and qualitative properties of a system by interpreting a mathematical model

## Resources for Students
