    "Consider an experiment or a random event such as flipping a coin or measuring wind speed and direction at a specific time and location. A **random variable** is a function that associates a numerical value with the outcome of an experiment or random event. If the range of values of a random variable $X$ is finite or countable (like the set of integers) then we call $X$ a **discrete random variable**. If the range of values of a random variable $X$ is uncountably infinite (like the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$) then we call $X$ a **continuous random variable**. For example:\n",

    "* Flip a coin and let $X = 1$ if the outcome is heads and $X = 0$ if the outcome is tails. Then $X$ is a discrete random variable.\n",
    "* Let $X$ be the total number of points scored in a basketball game. Then $X$ is a positive integer and so $X$ is a discrete random variable.\n",
    "* Let $X$ be the temperature measured at a specific time and location. The possible values of $X$ is the set of positive real numbers and so $X$ is a continous random variable.\n",
