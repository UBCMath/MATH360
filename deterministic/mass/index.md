# Mass Balance

## Big Ideas

* The **law of conservation of mass** gives rise to systems of differential equations which model the transfer of mass.
* **Constitutive laws** such as the **law of mass action** for checmial reactions describe individual components of a mathematical model. Constitutive laws are themselves mathematical models!
* The law of conservatin of mass is very general! It applies to any quantities that are flowing in and out of a system. Even a financial system where money is flowing in and out.
* Any model of a real-world phenomenon will involve many **parameters** and the **nondimensionalization** procedure simplifies the model and determines what role the system parameters play.
* Use **SciPy** to compute **numerical solutions** of differential equations. A computational approach to mathematical modelling allows us to easily simulate and visualize models.

## Learning Goals

* Apply physical laws to construct mathematical models of mass transfer
* Apply nondimensionalization process and interpret dimensionless parameters
* Compute numerical solutions of systems of differential equations
