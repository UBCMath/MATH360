# Nondimensionalization

## Bid Ideas

* All **physical quantities** are combinations of **base quantities** such as time, length, mass and temperature.
* The **dimensions** of a physical quantity refers to its expression in terms of the base quantities.
* **Nondimensionalization** is the process of **scalng variables** in a differential equation to **simplify the model** and to identify key properties of the model in terms of **dimensionless parameters**.

## Learning Goals

* Identify dimensions and units of variables and parameters in a mathematical model
* Apply nondimensionalization procedure to a mathematical model
* Interpret dimensionless parameters in a nondimensionalized mathematical model
