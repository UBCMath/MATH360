# Differential Equations

## Big Ideas

Deterministic models are often described by systems of **differential equations**. We can apply **analytical methods** to solve differential equations in special cases such as **first order separable equations** and **second order constant coefficient equations**. We use **SciPy** to **approximate solutions** of any system of differential equations. A computational approach to mathematical modelling allows us to spend more time **simulating models** as opposed to studying analytical methods. Every higher order system of differential equations is equivalent to a first order system in higher dimensions therefore **numerical methods** are designed for first order systems and we **transform higher order systems** into **first order systems** to apply numerical methods.
