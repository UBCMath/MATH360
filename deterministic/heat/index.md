# Heat Transfer

## Big Ideas

* The **law of conservation of energy** gives rise to systems of differential equations which models heat transfer.
* **Constitutive laws** such as the **Stefanâ€“Boltzmann law** are equations that describe individual components of a mathematical model. Constitutive laws are themselves mathematical models!
* Any model of a real-world phenomenon will involve many **parameters** and the **nondimensionalization** procedure simplifies the model and determines what role the system parameters play.
* Use **SciPy** to compute **numerical solutions** of differential equations. A computational approach to mathematical modelling allows us to easily simulate and visualize models.

## Learning Goals

* Apply physical laws to construct mathematical models of heat transfer
* Apply nondimensionalization process and interpret dimensionless parameters
* Compute numerical solutions of systems of differential equations
