    "Modelling problems are open-ended: there are many different solutions, different levels of complexity, and different tools that can be applied. It's a challenge even to know where to start! To begin the modelling process, we need to clearly state the problem so that we know what we are trying to solve."

We should be able to indentify the varaibles from a clearly articulated problem statement. **Parameters** are quantities that appear in the relationships between variables. We must list all variables and parameters in the system, give each a name and symbol and identify their **dimensions** such as length, mass and time."

For example, we often assume that the force of gravity is constant for an object moving near the surface of the Earth. However we would not assume that the gravitational forces of celestial bodies are always constant. **Constraints** describe the values that our variables and parameters are allowed to take. For example, the mass of an object is always positive."

It should be clear from the context if our model is deterministic, stochastic, data-driven or perhaps a combination. Once we have decided on the kind of model to use, we apply all the tools available."
